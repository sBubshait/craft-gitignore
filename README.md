## Getting Started

### Installation

   Start by installing the Craft-gitignore npm package globally:

   ```shell
   npm install -g craft-gitignore
   ```

   *Note*: You may need to use sudo for installation, depending on your system's permissions.

### Usage:

    Simply, run the following command in your project's root directory:

    ```shell
    craft-gitignore
    ```

    Optionally, you can specify a different directory to analyze by providing it as an argument:
    
    ```shell
        craft-gitignore /path/to/directory
    ```

    *Note*: If no directory is specified, the current working directory will be used.
    *Note*: The path can be either absolute or relative. So, you can use `craft-gitignore ./src` for example.
